## Simple home server with Raspberry Pi and Docker

The goal of this project is to prepare a home server using Raspberry Pi 4B computer. I decided to run everything using docker so all the apps I would use there would be contenerized (self-hosted). The server will have two disks - one for the operating system and keeping data and the second just for making backup. 

## Architecture
Since I wanted to forward only one port through my router (it is the easiest way to access your server from outside networks) I decided to use VPN gateway. That is why I connected all app containers into my custom bridge network and acces it (the network) through VPN container.

As you can see in the picture there is only one port forwarded in my <b>router</b>. It will forward all requests to RPi VPN port and they will go through <b>wireguard container</b>. When the PC (local or not) has successful VPN connection then it will access <b>custom bridge network</b> and will be able to call all containers by theirs names, i.e. <b>http://nextcloud_container_name:443</b>. There is no other way to access those containers since they are not exposing any ports (see X symbol).

The only container that is exposing a port is portainer. I left it exposed to be able to connect from local network in case wireguard container is broken. I'll be able to look into containers without using ssh.
