## Simple home server with Raspberry Pi and Docker

The goal of this project is to prepare a home server using Raspberry Pi 4B computer. I decided to run everything using docker so all the apps I would use there would be contenerized (self-hosted). The server will have two disks - one for the operating system and keeping data and the second just for making backup. 

## Architecture
Since I wanted to forward only one port through my router (it is the easiest way to access your server from outside networks) I decided to use VPN gateway. That is why I connected all app containers into my custom bridge network and acces it (the network) through VPN container.

As you can see in the picture there is only one port forwarded in my <b>router</b>. It will forward all requests to RPi VPN port and they will go through <b>wireguard container</b>. When the PC (local or not) has successful VPN connection then it will access <b>custom bridge network</b> and will be able to call all containers by theirs names, i.e. <b>http://nextcloud_container_name:443</b>. There is no other way to access those containers since they are not exposing any ports (see X symbol).

The only container that is exposing a port is portainer. I left it exposed to be able to connect from local network in case wireguard container is broken. I'll be able to look into containers without using ssh.

## Setup - list of content

This setup will cover:
* :arrow_right: [server setup](https://github.com/btk44/raspberrypi-server/tree/main/server-setup)
  * installing operating system and accessing it via ssh
  * description of issues that occured during the setup
* :arrow_right: [docker setup](https://github.com/btk44/raspberrypi-server/tree/main/docker-setup)
  * installing docker
  * installing docker containers: portainer, nextcloud, wireguard, samba (docker-compose and using portainer)
  * setting up a custom bridge network to access containers only through VPN connection
  * installing wireguard client on ubuntu/debian and connecting to the server
  * description of issues that occured during the setup
* :arrow_right: [backup setup](https://github.com/btk44/raspberrypi-server/tree/main/backup-setup)
  * setting up automatic backup using crontab and rsync (+ fstab mounting option)
  * description of issues that occured during the usage

## Warning! Before you start:
It may seem that home server would be easy to set up and will work like cloud storage. Unfortunately this is not entirely true. I will put a list with issues / comments that occured in my case. It might be short but I will add more if anything new will occur.
* server speed depends on your internet connection (upload and download speeds) - remember that
* RPi transfer is faster via cable than wifi 
* when RPi was connected via cable to my router some other devices in my network (1 PC, 1 phone and a printer) had issues with wifi connection
* my RPi cannot power 2x2.5" (one ssd and one hdd) drives connected via USB (no matter if usb2 or usb3) - it was causing errors and I needed to reboot the system. I have only one ssd disk (with the system) connected and the rest is connected via USB hub with external power supply.
